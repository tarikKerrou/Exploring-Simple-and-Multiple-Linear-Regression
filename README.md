# Exploring-Simple-and-Multiple-Linear-Regression
This repository contains a project that explores simple and multiple linear regression concepts using real-world data sets.
The project is a repository that explores simple and multiple linear regression concepts using real-world datasets. It consists of a collection of Jupyter notebooks that cover various topics related to linear regression, such as data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and prediction. The notebooks use real-world datasets, such as the Boston Housing dataset, the Wine Quality dataset, and the Advertising dataset, to illustrate the concepts of linear regression.

The project also covers various techniques for building linear regression models, such as ordinary least squares (OLS), gradient descent, and regularization techniques like Ridge and Lasso. It also covers model evaluation techniques like R-squared, adjusted R-squared, mean squared error (MSE), and root mean squared error (RMSE).

Overall, the project provides a comprehensive introduction to simple and multiple linear regression concepts using real-world datasets. It is a valuable resource for anyone looking to learn about linear regression and its applications in data analysis and modeling.
